    The Game is played between two players that each take control
    of one set of colored pieces (White and Black).
    The goal of the game is to capture the opponents King.
    If a player cannot prevent the capture of his King in the next turn, he
    or she is declared checkmate and the game ends.

    White always starts (the color on the bottom of the screen, it might look
    like another color on your screen) and every player can move one piece
    per turn. For further rules of how to play the game you better google a bit.

    To tell the game which piece you want to move where, you have to enter the
    start and end coordinates (in lowercase letters) Ã  la 'e2:e4'.
    Castling works the same, and you can save the game at any point by
    entering 'save' or exit it by entering 'quit'.

    Now, have Fun!"
